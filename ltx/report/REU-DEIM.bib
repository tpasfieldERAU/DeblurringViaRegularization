If you imagine imaging a very small point like object an image of that object is called the Point Spread Function ({PSF}). When this function is radially averaged the Line Spread Function ({LSF}) is generated. Taking the Fourier Transform of the {LSF} yields the Modulation Transfer Function ({MTF}) which measures how spatial frequencies pass through the system. The way that we measure how different frequencies of noise propagate through the system is the Noise Power Spectrum ({NPS}). Finally a metric of how well the system is using the information in the incoming x-rays is the Detective Quantum Efficiency ({DQE}). In this article we will be going through these concepts so that you can understand the basics of what is called linear systems theory.},

	title = {A Dynamic Amplitude-Correcting Gradient Estimation Technique to Align X-ray Focusing Optics},
	abstract = {High-brightness X-rays, as produced at synchrotrons and X-ray free electron laser ({XFEL}) facilities, are used to characterize materials in a variety of scientiﬁc experiments. In most cases, eﬀective use of the high-energy light requires precisely-aligned focusing optics; one example being a compound refractive lens ({CRL}). To align a {CRL}, the position and rotation must be optimized along four axes. In practice, this is a labor-intensive, time-consuming manual process that can monopolize scarce experimental time at the necessary X-ray facilities. Models of the expected Xray transmission function suggest that this task can be automated; however, the temporally-varying intensity at X-ray free electron laser facilities preclude the direct use of standard implementations of optimization solvers such as steepest descent algorithms. In this paper, we propose a novel technique to estimate the gradient of noisy functions with temporally-varying amplitudes. We construct this dynamicamplitude correction by systematically sampling a ﬁxed central location within the standard ﬁnite diﬀerence stencil, accounting for the observed changes in time, and normalizing the diﬀerence quotients against those ﬂuctuations. In addition to a rigorous error analysis of the sampling technique, we demonstrate its eﬃcacy in stochastic descent optimization methods. Further, we demonstrate how this approach may be implemented to optimize X-ray focusing optics at synchrotrons or {XFEL} facilities.},

	abstract = {The point spread function ({PSF}) of a translation invariant imaging system is its impulse response, which cannot always be measured directly. This is the case in high energy X-ray radiography, and it must be estimated from images of calibration objects indirectly related to the impulse response. When the {PSF} is assumed to have radial symmetry, it can be estimated from an image of an opaque straight edge. We use a non-parametric Bayesian approach, where the prior probability density for the {PSF} is modeled as a Gaussian Markov random ﬁeld and radial symmetry is incorporated in a novel way. Markov Chain Monte Carlo posterior estimation is carried out by adapting a recently developed improvement to the Gibbs sampling algorithm, referred to as partially collapsed Gibbs sampling. Moreover, the algorithm we present is proven to satisfy invariance with respect to the target density. Finally, we demonstrate the eﬃcacy of these methods on radiographic data obtained from a high-energy X-ray diagnostic system at the U.S. Department of Energy’s Nevada National Security Site.},

	abstract = {One of the primary causes of blur in a high energy X-ray imaging system is the shape and extent of the radiation source, or ‘spot’. It is important to be able to quantify the size of the spot as it provides a lower bound on the recoverable resolution for a radiograph, and penumbral imaging methods – which involve the analysis of blur caused by a structured aperture – can be used to obtain a spatial proﬁle of the spot. We present a Bayesian approach for estimating the spot proﬁle that, unlike variational methods, is robust to the initial choice of parameters. The posterior is obtained from a normal approximation to a Poisson likelihood, and prior assumptions enforce both smoothness and non-negativity constraints. A Markov chain Monte Carlo ({MCMC}) algorithm is used to obtain samples from the target posterior, and the reconstruction and uncertainty estimates are the computed mean and variance of the samples, respectively. Synthetic data sets are used to demonstrate accurate reconstruction while real data taken with high energy X-ray imaging systems are used to demonstrate applicability and feasibility.},

In this work we solve the deconvolution problem within a Bayesian framework for edge-enhancing reconstruction with uncertainty quantification. The likelihood is a normal approximation to the Poisson likelihood, and the prior is generated from a classical total variation regularized Poisson deconvolution. Samples from the corresponding posterior distribution are computed using a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach, giving a pointwise measure of uncertainty in the reconstructed signal. We demonstrate the results on real data used to calibrate a high-energy X-ray source and show that this approach gives reconstructions as good as classical regularization methods, while mitigating many of their drawbacks.},

The methodology presented in this paper is based on a direct fit of a mathematical expression of the edge spread function ({ESF}) profile to the {ESF} data acquired at the interface between different materials. The mathematical expression of {ESF} was determined by approximating the line spread function ({LSF}) of the system with a sinc function. The proposed methodology can be applied using signal data from magnitude {MRI} spin echo images and is not sensitive to noise amplification introduced by differentiating the {ESF} to produce the {LSF}, as performed in previous studies.

The total variation based model by Rudin-Osher-Fatemi (1992) is one of the most effective and well known due to its ability to preserve sharp features in restoration. This paper addresses an important and yet outstanding issue for this model in selection of an optimal regularization parameter, for the case of image deblurring. We propose to compute the optimal regularization parameter along with the restored image in the same variational setting, by considering a Karush Kuhn Tucker ({KKT}) system. Through establishing analytically the monotonicity result, we can compute this parameter by an iterative algorithm for the {KKT} system. Such an approach corresponds to solving an equation using discrepancy principle, rather than using discrepancy principle only as a stopping criterion. Numerical experiments show that the algorithm is efficient and effective for image deblurring problems and yet is competitive.},

	abstract = {Deblurring is the inverse problem of restoring an image that has been blurred and possibly corrupted with noise. Deconvolution refers to the case where the blur to be removed is linear and shift-invariant so it may be expressed as a convolution of the image with a point spread function. Convolution corresponds in the Fourier domain to multiplication, and deconvolution is essentially Fourier division. The challenge is that since the multipliers are often small for high frequencies, direct division is unstable and plagued by noise present in the input image. Eﬀective deconvolution requires a balance between frequency recovery and noise suppression.},
