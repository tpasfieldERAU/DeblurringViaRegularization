	url = {https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1835841},
	abstract = {Many scientific experiments such as those found in astronomy, geology, microbiology, and X-ray radiography require the use of high-energy instruments to capture images. Since blur and noise are inevitably present in any imaging system, the images must be {\textbackslash}deblurred" to extract the full information content. Mathematically, image deblurring is an ill-posed inverse problem that requires regularization. The regularization, in turn, has a large effect on the deblurred image: different regularization strengths, and types, lead to drastically different reconstructions. Moreover, many images contain a mixture of smooth and sharp features which suggests the use of multi-regularization, i.e., varying the type of regularization (e.g. Tikhonov or total variation) across the image. We address these issues by formulating the image deblurring problem within a hierarchical Bayesian framework in which we spatially adapt the strength of the regularization and also vary the regularization type across the image. In this way, the image itself, along with corresponding regularization strength at each pixel, are described jointly by a posterior distribution which we can sample by Markov chain Monte Carlo ({MCMC}) methods. We illustrate our techniques on simplified test problems and apply them to high-energy X-ray images taken at the Nevada National Security Site. Numerical tests show that our new method is robustly applicable and increases the quality of the image reconstruction when compared to other (Bayesian) methods.},

	abstract = {The regularization approach is used widely in image restoration problems. The visual quality of the restored image depends highly on the regularization parameter. In this paper, we develop an automatic way to choose a good regularization parameter for total variation ({TV}) image restoration problems. It is based on the generalized cross validation ({GCV}) approach and hence no knowledge of noise variance is required. Due to the lack of the closedform solution of the {TV} regularization problem, diﬃculty arises in ﬁnding the minimizer of the {GCV} function directly. We reformulate the {TV} regularization problem as a minimax problem and then apply a ﬁrst-order primal-dual method to solve it. The primal subproblem is rearranged so that it becomes a special Tikhonov regularization problem for which the minimizer of the {GCV} function is readily computable. Hence we can determine the best regularization parameter in each iteration of the primal-dual method. The regularization parameter for the original {TV} regularization problem is then obtained by an averaging scheme. In essence, our method needs only to solve the {TV} regulation problem twice: one to determine the regularization parameter and one to restore the image with that parameter. Numerical results show that our method gives near optimal parameter, and excellent performance when compared with other state-of-the-art adaptive image restoration algorithms.},
